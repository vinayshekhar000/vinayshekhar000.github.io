I am a Graduate student(Masters of Language Technologies) in Langauge Technologies Institute at the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. I work in the field of Nautral language processing.I am interested in the use of state of the art NLP techniques to help people improve their daily lives. I am particulary interested in the field of text generation. I am also interested in applied machine learning and in this regard working on helping people understand and interpret privacy policies.
